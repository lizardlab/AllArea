# AllArea

The first and greatest area calculation software.
AllArea is a Python program meant to take away the need of manual (surface) area and volume calculation. It is also meant to be very simple to use and very accessible by providing both a CLI and GUI version.

## Running AllArea
Running AllArea is simple, all you need is python and python-tk (which usually comes with python). Then just run:

`python <filename.py>`

Or in Windows if you have Python installed correctly, you can simply click on the file (if it's the GUI version).
It's that simple! For actual production use please download it from the [website](http://burnedtoast.cu.cc/allarea/download). We also provide binaries for Windows so you do not need Python.

## Coming soon...
Currently underway is a complete redesign of the GUI portion of AllArea migrating from the current ancient system of Tk and going over the WxWidgets. This radical change will allow for a dropdown menu instead of that huge list of buttons. On a much lesser priority is integrating a splash screen into the NSIS installer.

## Help wanted!
As you can see on the site, we currently do not have any packages for Debian, Ubuntu, or Arch! Any help with packaging AllArea for those systems would be *greatly* appreciated. Also if someone could code in a way to get rid of the ugly command line window that shows up for the GUI that would be wonderful too.
